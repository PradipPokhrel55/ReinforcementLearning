## 🚀 Getting Started

### 
1. Clone the Repository

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/PradipPokhrel55/ReinforcementLearning.git
   cd ReinforcementLearning/Snake
##

2. **Create and activate a virtual environment**

   ```bash
   python3.10 -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate
##

3. **Install dependencies**
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
##
4. **run the agent**
    ```bash
    python agent.py

After training my agent for over 1000+ games, I finally achieved a score of 30!
This plot shows how the model learns, improves, and adapts over time.
