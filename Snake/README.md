#implemented reinforcement learning in snake game

Implementation of Deep Q-learning in a snake game and sanke learns to play the snake game by itself.


##used technology

language: Python 
model building: Pytorch
others: numpy , matplotlib 

##Getting started 
. **Clone the repository**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/PradipPokhrel55/ReinforcementLearning/tree/main/Snake
   
##

2. **Create and activate a virtual environment**

   ```bash
   python -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate
##

3. **Install dependencies**
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
##
4. **run the agent**
    ```bash
    python agent.py

After training my agent for over 1000+ games, I finally achieved a score of 30!
This plot shows how the model learns, improves, and adapts over time.
